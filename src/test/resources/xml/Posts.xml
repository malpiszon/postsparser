But there appears to be more to this approach, where it links to the results of previously successfully adjudicated markets.  Does anyone know how this mechanism works in practice?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastActivityDate="2017-08-03T00:20:01.090" Title="How does the final phase of Augur Market adjudication work and what is the difference from AgnosticPM?"
